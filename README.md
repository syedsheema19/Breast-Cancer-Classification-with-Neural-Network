Breast Cancer Classification with a simple Neural Network (NN)
Importing the Dependencies
Data Collection & Processing
we will print how amny rows and columns are there
1 --> Benign

0 --> Malignant
divided the data in to x nad y 
x will be the feature columns and y will be the target columns
Splitting the data into training data & Testing data
we will create a standard sclaer
creating a neural network by giving input layers and with activation of sigmoid 
complile the the ntwork
we wiil see the accuarcy
